1 Our First Java Program

Below is our first Java program of the semester. Next to each line, write out what
you think the code will do when run. If you think the line will result in an error,
correct it, and proceed through the code as if it is running your corrected version.
This exercise is adapted from Head First Java

int size = 27;
String name = "Fido";
Dog myDog = new Dog(name, size);
Dog yourDog = new Dog("Scruffy", 1000);
Dog[] dogList = new Dog[3];
dogList[0] = myDog;
dogList[1] = yourDog;
doglist[2] = new Dog("Cutie", 8)
int x = size - 5;
if (x < 15) {
    myDog.bark();
}
